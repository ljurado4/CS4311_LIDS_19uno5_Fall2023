### Installation
**Prerequisites**:
   1. Ensure you have Python installed 3.10.12 installed
   ```
   python --version  # Check your current Python version
   ```
   2. Ensure Â´install.sh' has execution permissions.
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

#### Automated Installation
The installation script (`install.sh`) is provided in the root of this project to simplify installation. This script sets up the virtual environment, installs the necessary dependencies, and prepares the system for running this code. 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/ljurado4/CS4311_LIDS_19uno5_Fall2023.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd CS4311_LIDS_19uno5_Fall2023
```

3. Run `install.sh`.
```
./install.sh
```

#### Activate the virtual environment manually
In case `install.sh` is unable to recognize the O.S. of your machine, run the corresponding command:
**Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows using CMD:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
   - On Mac or Linux:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

### Usage

#### CLI

To interact with LIDS via CLI, navigate to the CLI folder and run the following command:
python3 main_cli.py --config_file=your_config.xml

#### Web UI

Once the environment is active:
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Start the Flask server by running `python app.py`. (FYI macOS will require you to still run python3)
=======

Once the server is running, access the Web UI by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.
