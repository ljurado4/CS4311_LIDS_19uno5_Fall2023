# File: simulate_unkown_ips.py
#
# Description: This script is intended to simulate network traffic from random IP addresses to a specified destination, typically for the purpose of testing network intrusion detection systems or similar security mechanisms. It generates packets with random source IPs and sends them to a defined destination IP and port. Additionally, it captures live network trafficusing PyShark and allows for the inspection of these packets.
